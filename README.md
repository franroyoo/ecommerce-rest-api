## REST API eCommerce
REST API developed for didactic purposes.
My main goal is to extend its functionalities as I learn new technologies and best practices. The API has the following characteristics:

* Registration and login with email verification.
* Authentication based on JWT tokens.
* Unit testing and integration testing with JUnit5 and Mockito.
* Generation of order receipt through consumption of external API.
* Role system (USER, PREMIUM, ADMIN).
* Global exception handling.
* Continuous code refactoring following best practices (DRY, SOLID, CLEAN CODE).
  
## UPCOMING FEATURES/CHANGES:
* Asynchronous programming in methods that require high execution time.
* Migration to Hexagonal Architecture.
* Discount system using Strategy pattern.
